* Project Description

** Note
This started as a fun project to learn about rust and USB. It is a hobby project and changes/features are implemented
as my free time permits. Please use caution before using this software as I assume no responsibility if it does not work or
causes problems with your device.

This is an utility for programming small keyboards like this one:

[[images/keyboard-6-1.png]]
[[images/keyboard-12-2.png]]
[[images/keyboard-3-1.jpg]]
[[images/keyboard-4-0.png]]

Many of these keyboards are popular on AliExpress and Amazon, but the seller usually makes you
download a windows exe file from a google drive account to program it. It also assumes
- you use Windows (which I do not)
- is clunky/shady (imho)
- most importantly does not expose all keyboard features

* Installation
Clone the repository and build the tool

#+begin_example
cargo build --release
#+end_example

* Configuration Mappings

** Orientation

Normal macropad orienation is when buttons are on the left
side and rotary encoders are on the right. However, you may want to use
the macropad in another orienation. To avoid remapping button
positions in your head, just set it here.
Possible values are:
  (horizontal)
  - 'normal': buttons on the left, rotary encoders on the right
  - 'upsidedown': buttons on the right, rotary encoders on the left
  (vertical)
  - 'clockwise': buttons on the top, rotary encoders on the bottom
  - 'counterclockwise': buttons on the bottom, rotary encoders on the top

#+begin_src ron
(
    device: (
        orientation: "normal",
#+end_src

** Macropad Setup

There are different models of macropad with different numbers
of buttons and rotary encoders. Set it here for proper handling.
Count rows and columns with the macropad in normal orienation,
with rotary encoders on the right side.

#+begin_src ron
        rows: 3,
        cols: 4,
        knobs: 2,
    ),
#+end_src

** Layers

The current layer is changed using a button on the side of the macropad
and displayed with LEDs on top (only for the moment of changing).
All macropads I saw had three layers

#+begin_src ron
    layers: [
        (
#+end_src

*** Buttons
Array of buttons. In horizontal orienations it's `rows` rows
`columns` buttons each. In vertical: `columns` rows
`rows` buttons

Each entry is either a sequence of keychords or a mouse event.
A keychord is a combination of one key with optional modifiers,
like 'b', 'ctrl-alt-a' or 'win-rctrl-backspace'. It can also
be just modifiers without a key: 'ctrl-alt'

You can combine up to 17 chords into a sequence using commas: 'ctrl-c,ctrl-v'

#+begin_src ron
            buttons: [
                ["ctrl-a,ctrl-s", "b", "c", "d"],
                ["e", "f", "alt-shift", "h"],
                ["i", "j", "k", "l"],
            ],
#+end_src

*** Rotary Encoders

Rotary encoders (aka knobs) are listed from left to right if horizontal
and from top to bottom if vertical. They can be rotated counter-clockwise (ccw) or clockwise (cw)
and pressed down like a button

#+begin_src ron
            knobs: [
                (ccw: "volumedown", press: "mute", cw: "volumeup"),
                (ccw: "1", press: "2", cw: "3"),
            ],
        ),
#+end_src

*** Mouse Events

Mouse events are clicks ('click', 'rclick', 'mclick') or
wheel events ('wheelup', 'wheeldown') with one optional modifier,
only 'ctrl', 'shift' and 'alt' are supported ('ctrl-wheeldown')
Clicks may combine several buttons, like this: 'click+rclick'

#+begin_src ron
        (
            buttons: [
                ["click", "mclick", "rclick", "2"],
                ["wheelup", "2", "wheeldown", "2"],
                ["2", "ctrl-wheelup", "2", "ctrl-wheeldown"],
            ],
            knobs: [
                (ccw: "2", press: "2", cw: "2"),
                (ccw: "2", press: "2", cw: "2"),
            ],
        ),
#+end_src

*** Multimedia Support

Multimedia commands are also supported. Howerver, they cannot be mixed with normal keys and modifiers

#+begin_src ron
        (
            buttons: [
                ["ctrl-m", "ctrl-slash", "space", "p"],
                ["ctrl-rightbracket", "ctrl-leftbracket", "right", "left"],
                ["play", "volumeup", "volumedown", "next"],
            ],
            knobs: [
                (ccw: "3", press: "mute", cw: "3"),
                (ccw: "3", press: "3", cw: "3"),
            ],
        ),
    ],
)

* Usage

** udev rules for linux
To access the device without being root, copy the 80-macropad.rules to /etc/udev/rules.d and reload udev

#+begin_example
sudo cp 80-macropad.rules /etc/udev/rules.d
sudo udevadm trigger
#+end_example

** Supported keys
A list of supported keys can be found by running

#+begin_example
macropad-tool show-keys
#+end_example

** Validate configuration

#+begin_example
macropad-tool validate # by default looks for a mapping.ron file
macropad-tool validate -c <ron_file>  # to specify a different configuration file
#+end_example

** Write to keyboard
Needs root access or ensure udev rules was added. For Windows, need Administrator command prompt

#+begin_example
macropad-tool program # by defult looks for a mapping.ron file
macropad-tool program -c <ron_file>  # to specify a different configuration file
#+end_example

* Windows

** Compiling
Installing rust with the installer prompts to install visual studio community edition (which is free) and is sufficient to build the executable

** Running the Application
- You will need to install the USB Development Kit to be able to talk to the macropad. https://github.com/daynix/UsbDk/releases
